## Kebs for IntelliJ

The code generated by macros in `kebs-tagged-meta` is not visible to IntelliJ IDEA. There is [Kebs for IntelliJ](https://github.com/theiterators/kebs-intellij)
plugin that enhances experience with the library by adding support for generated code. You can install it from the IntelliJ Marketplace.
In the Settings/Preferences dialog, select "Plugins" and type "Kebs" into search input (see https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/managing-plugins.html for detailed instructions).
You can also use this web page: https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/16069-kebs.
